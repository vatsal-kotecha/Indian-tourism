Brahma Sarovar is an ancient water tank sacred to Hinduism in Thanesar, in the state of Haryana, North India. <br>
Hinduism stresses on having a bath in the sarovar for internal and external sanctity, purity and bliss forever. Most religious places have water tanks or sarovars in the vicinity of temple or gurdwara. The temple is one of very few existing temples dedicated to the Hindu creator-god Brahma in India and remains the most prominent among them.<br>
Although the present temple structure dates to the 14th century, the temple is believed to be 2000 years old. The temple is mainly built of marble and stone stabs. It has a distinct red pinnacle (shikhara) and a hamsa bird motif. The temple sanctum sanctorum holds the central images of Brahma and his second consort Gayatri.
